# Data_Vis_Shiny_Proj
Data visualization class - a shiny app exploring global human displacement

This is a final 4-person group project for the data visualization class at columbia University in the QMSS department. The final app looks at global human displacement since the 1960s, with tabs dedicated to the following:
 - An overview of the increase in displacement over time
 - Mapping the top refugee origin and destination countries, as well as top countries for internal displacement
 - The phases of refugee displacement, caused by decolonization in the 60s to political instability in the 21st century
 - A close look at Yemeni and Syrian human displacement
 - Displacement trends comparing countries over time and the role of GDP per capita

My contributions to the project include:
 - initial brainstorming for the project
 - the content found in the last tab "Explore on your own!"
 - setting up the Shiny app, merging group members' work into the app files (ui.r, server.r, global.r)
